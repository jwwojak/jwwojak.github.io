# Joe Wojak

## About

I’m a technical writer with experience in creating documentation for external customers and internal engineering teams. I’ve managed large, established documentation libraries and created original documentation for new systems and services. My writing philosophy is to treat documentation like code. This means writing with open-source systems that accommodate community input and help reduce the documentation burden on developers.

## Experience

This is a selected chronology of my work experience. [Download my resume](Joe_Wojak_TechWriter.pdf) for a PDF version of this information.

- Returned to Adobe to write external, customer-facing documentation for Audience Manager. Efforts brought neglected documentation up-to-date and reduced issue backlog.
