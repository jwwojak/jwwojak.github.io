# Joe Wojak

## About

- **Who:** I'm a technical writer experienced with creating documentation for external end-users and internal teams. I've worked at small startups and large, established companies alike.

- **What:** During my writing career, I've inherited and managed large documentation libraries and helped create new content for innovative and groundbreaking products and services. If you don't have good documentation, I can write it. If you have poor or disorganize documentation, I can fix it.

- **How:** For writing, I've used a variety of tools like simple HTML editors, complex DITA authoring systems ([Oxygen](https://www.oxygenxml.com/) and [XMetaL](https://xmetal.com/)), and static site generators like [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). My writing follows Darwin Information Typing Architecture ([DITA](https://www.xml.com/articles/2017/01/19/what-dita/)) standards for technical documentation. I treat documentation like code and keep that content with the code.
