# Joe Wojak

## About

I’m a technical writer with experience in creating documentation for external customers and internal engineering teams. My focus has been on ad tech, but expanded at Spotify to include a broad array of engineering topics. During my career, I’ve managed large, established documentation libraries and created content for new systems and services. My writing philosophy is to treat documentation like code and keep that content with the code.
