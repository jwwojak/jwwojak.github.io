# Hello World

Hi and welcome. My name is Joe Wojak. I'm a technical writer in NYC.

This site contains my resume and technical writing guide. 

Regarding the writing guide, this represents a writing sample and reflects my thoughts about how to create and organize technical documentation. It's a writing reference that's grown over the years and I've used at all the companies I've worked at. For experienced technical writers, this information is not that new. Instead, this information is for engineers and developers who need to write documentation for the systems, services, and products that they build.

## Next steps
