# Introduction

This section contains examples of my technical documentation. This content was standalone documentation or part of a larger knowledge-base repository. Internal teams, customer service personnel, and external clients used this documentation. I’ve removed specific company and/or service names from most of these samples. The information in these articles describes real systems that, today, may or may not be in operation.

As a technical writer, I was often a one-person shop. I had little or no graphic design support for images and other visual features. As a result, I had to create my own illustrations for the documentation in this section. I’ve used tools like Visio, Adobe Illustrator, Google Drawings, and Lucid Chart to add images to my written work.
