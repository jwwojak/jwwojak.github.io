# Introduction Placeholder

[Opentrons](https://opentrons.com/) makes liquid handing robots. Laboratories use these robots to automate pipetting and other processes like polymerase chain reactions (PCR), nucleic acid extraction, and DNA sequencing.

The writing samples in this section include an instruction manual for the  [Flex liquid handing robot](https://opentrons.com/products/flex/), quickstart guides for Flex-compatible instruments and modules, and Python API documentation. I am also not the sole author of this work. All of this content was written in collaboration with my manager and senior writer.
