# Introduction Placeholder

[Opentrons](https://opentrons.com/) makes liquid handing robots for laboratory work. I was hired as a temp, and then became full-time, to help write the instruction manual and other customer-facing content for the [Flex liquid handing robot](https://opentrons.com/products/flex/). Unlike the other writing samples in this section, all of my work is publicly available online via the links below. I am also not the sole author of this work. All of this content is written in collaboration with my manager who is the senior writer at the company.
