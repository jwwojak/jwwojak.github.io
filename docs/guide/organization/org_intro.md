# Introduction

This section of the writing guide is designed to help engineering teams organize new documentation or revise the structure of an existing content repo. This organization guide:

- Suggests an ideal organizational hierarchy for each of the main sections in your documentation.

- Lists and describes the purpose of each main section in a well-ordered documentation space.

- Outlines the sections and content _within_ important individual pages in your documentation.

You may have other valuable ideas about what constitutes a good documentation space. If thatâ€™s the case, fantastic! We encourage you to act on those thoughts and go for it. Let that passion and vision come out in your content organization and writing. However, we still encourage you to review this guide. Something here may help refine or improve your documentation ideas.

## Next steps
