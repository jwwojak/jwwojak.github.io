# Task Documentation for Complex Procedures

Complex procedures are tasks that require 6 (or more) steps to complete. Similar to [simple task documentation][1], explain how to use the thing you built rather than why you created it.

## Examples

For tasks that require a lot of steps, organize the instructions into short sections and restart the step numbers in each new section. Here's an example of how to write a long, complex task document.

## Features

Task documentation for long, complex procedures includes the same textual components as a [simple task document][1]. These include:

- Separating steps into related sections.
- Numbered steps (if steps must be completed sequentially). Restart the numbering in each section.

- Bulleted steps (if steps don't need to follow in sequential order).

- Step options and step results.

- Images.

## Style advice

Group related sets of steps together. For example, maybe your process begins with steps that require you to name and describe something. Later steps may require connecting to data sets or identifying external customers. Organize related steps into their own sections and identify that part of the process with a logical [section header][2]. See also, the style advice in [Task Documentation for Simple Procedures][1].
