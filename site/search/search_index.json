Unfortunately, no one knows what they are. \u2014 Somerset Maugham Hello world Welcome to the Technical Writing Guide . The Guide is designed to help engineers with rules and advice for writing technical documentation. The underlying philosophy is to treat documentation like code and keep content with the code. This means a writing system should use a simple language like Markdown and use a development environments engineers are familiar with (e.g., Visual Studio and GitHub). I hope the information in this guide helps you write documentation that's confident, clear, accurate, and authoritative. Why write documentation Writing good documentation is essential. It helps everyone in your organization understand and use the services and systems that you create. But, sometimes writing is a difficult, intimidating, and tedious activity. Maybe you're unsure about what to include, exclude, or how to organize written content. As a result, we've created this guide. It can help you understand how to write, organize content, and resolve common technical writing issues. Secondary goals This work represents a writing sample and reflects my thoughts about how to create and organize technical documentation. It's a writing reference that's grown over the years. I've used it, in one form or another, at all the companies I've worked for. If you're an experienced technical writer, this information is not that new. Instead, this information is for less experienced content creators (e.g., engineers and developers) who need to write documentation for the systems, services, and products that they build. Next steps Here are suggestions about where to go next: Topic-Based Writing and Documentation Types : An introduction and short primer on organizing complex technical subjects into topics and specific document topic types. Organizing Sections and Pages : An outline and description of how to organize the table of contents and individual sections in your documentation space.

Flexibility and creativity are good, but we're going to be strict here. Review this section for rules and examples that can help you write clear, concise API descriptions. Style basics When writing API documentation, try to: Write in the present tense and in the active voice . Present-tense, active-voice writing is strong and confident. Start descriptions with a verb in the imperative mood (e.g., create, update, save, build, push, etc). Describe what each method does right away. Don't waste time with background content or context. Create and link to separate, but related, content when API features are too complicated to explain in a few short sentences. Description structure These recommendations follow a Swagger type structure for API development and documentation. Specific keys or parameters may not match the tools you're using, but the writing concepts presented here should be applicable across different API development platforms. First sentence The first sentence of an API description concisely describes the function of a particular method. In your text: Use the summary parameter. Add more information or links with the description parameter. Limit the main description to a single sentence only! Start with a verb in the imperative as shown in the examples below. Subsequent sentences or supporting text Supporting text provides more information and links about a method. Use the description parameter to identify this text. Example /section/section: method: summary: \"Some text here.\" description: \"Even more text here.\" Verbs for method descriptions Usually, repetition in writing is bad and tedious. In the case of API docs, repetition, or, perhaps more accurately, consistency , is your friend. As we're writing about a limited set of commands, it's good to have the description for each command start with the same word. So, try to be consistent in how you start method descriptions. Each description for a method type ( POST , GET , DELETE , PUT , etc.) should have it's own verb. Start the description with the verb that matches the method. Use a verb in the imperative like this: \"returns,\" \"deletes,\" \"creates,\" \"tests,\" etc. See the method descriptions below. If these don't work it's OK to try something else. Whatever you do, just be consistent in doing it. Verb cheat sheet These are the recommended verbs you should use to start method descriptions. See also the examples in the next section below. Method Verb GET Returns DELETE Deletes POST POST methods can do a lot of different things. Try to match the verb to the action the method performs. Here are some examples: Creates Deletes Tests Returns Moves PUT PUT methods can do a lot of different things. Try to match the verb to the action the method performs. Here are some examples: Specifies Updates Appends Description examples Here are some pseudo-code examples to help you get started. DELETE methods For single or bulk-delete methods, start the description with the word \"Delete.\" /segments/ic:{integration code}: delete: summary: \"Deletes a specific segment by integration code.\" GET methods Start the description with the word \"Returns.\" /traits/: get: summary: \"Returns data for an algorithmic, on-boarded, or rules-based trait.\" POST methods POST methods can do various things. The verbs and ways to describe these can vary, but this behavior still lends itself to writing descriptions with a fixed set of verbs and terms. Refer to these examples when writing descriptions for POST methods. Tip When writing POST descriptions, try to start with a verb that most closely describes what the method does. Create example /traits/: post: summary: \"Creates a trait that defines part of an audience segment.\" Bulk delete example /segments/bulk-delete: post: summary: \"Deletes multiple segments with a single operation.\" Test or validate /traits/validate: post: summary: \"Tests the rule logic applied to a rules-based trait.\" Return data //The POST method returns data like a GET method. /segments/estimate-size: post: summary: \"Returns the total estimated segment size for 7-, 30-, and 60-day intervals.\" Moving objects /segments/bulk-replace: post: summary: \"Moves audiences in bulk from one segment to another.\" PUT methods PUT methods can do a variety of things like POST methods. The verbs and ways to describe these can vary, but this behavior still lends itself to writing descriptions with a fixed set of verbs and terms. Refer to these examples when writing descriptions for PUT methods. Tip When writing PUT descriptions, try to start with a verb that most closely describes what the method does. Select or specify /folders/audiences/{folderId}: put: summary: \"Specifies a an audience folder ID to update with a new name, description, or move it to another location.\" Update or revise /audience/{aid}: put: summary: \"Updates a specific audince by audience ID.\" /segments/ic:{integration code}: put: summary: \"Appends an integration code to a request to revise the audience name or description.\"","title":"API Documentation"},{"location":"guide/api/api_intro/#api-documentation","text":"API descriptions should be consistent across and within methods.

It tries to meet the goals discussed in Homepage Theory and Purpose . Take a moment to review that article if you haven't read it yet. Sections outlined This outline shows you how to organize the major sections of your documentation homepage. I. Page title A. Introduction or short description II. Summary III. Next steps IV. Contribute (optional) V. Help and support section VI. Related topics (optional) Except for the introduction/short description, you can use the outline headers as the titles of each section. Tip For a visual overview, see the Homepage Quick Reference . Sections described Let\u2019s take a look at the typical contents and formatting of each section in a homepage. Page title A homepage title should include or suggest the name of your service, feature, or whatever it is you\u2019re writing about. Good page tiles help readers determine if a page or section contains the information they're looking for. Here are some examples: Implementing Apollo Services Working With gRPC Pipeline Orchestration With Flyte Introduction section The introduction or short description immediately follows the page title. It should welcome the reader to your docs site and/or briefly summarize your service or page contents. Don\u2019t try to write a complete explanation of your whole system in the introduction. Save that longer discussion for the summary section or another page. Style elements for an introduction section include: Using an H1 # title case title for page titles (e.g. # Implementing Apollo Services ). No section title. Let the page title start the short description. Just write your text. Complete, grammatically correct sentences. Summary section The summary section should contain 1-3 paragraphs that provide just enough information to describe your service. If you don't use a summary on the homepage and still want to describe your service, put that text in a separate overview section. Use an H2 ## sentence case title for the section headers. Text like ## Summary or ## Service overview are good examples of section titles. Next steps section What do you do after the introduction and summary? Well, you and your team are the subject matter experts. Put that knowledge to work and provide some recommendations for your readers. The \"Next steps\" section is your opportunity to guide people to information that you think is important. For instance: New users may want to know how to implement your system or how it works. In this case, referring them to getting started or overview content might be helpful. Experienced users might need help with a complex issue or question. Pointing them to a user guide, FAQ, or use cases could be another helpful link in this section. Style elements for a next steps section include: Using an H2 ## sentence case title for the section header (e.g., ## Next steps ). A bullet list of links to helpful resources. Short summaries of the content you choose to highlight in this section. Contribute section The contribution section describes how your readers can help improve your documentation or report errors. It is optional. Style elements for a contribution section include: Using an H2 ## sentence case title for the section header (e.g., ## Contribute ). A sentence, paragraph, or instructions that tell readers how to report bugs, issues, or lend a hand. Help and support section After explaining to your readers who you are, what you do, and where to go next, provide contact information about the team that manages the service described in the documentation. Taking responsibility for your service documentation is essential. You wrote it, you own it. Format this section as a simple bullet list that includes things like your Slack channels, group emails, Stack Overflow, or other resources. Style elements include: Using an H2 ## sentence case title for the section header (e.g., ## Help and support ) Contact information (e.g., Slack, gmail, Stack Overflow, etc.) in a bullet list. Link to these when you can. Stack Overflow Tip If your company has its own instance of Stack Overflow, link to that resource and add code that automatically populates the Tags field with a tag related to your service (e.g. https://mycompany.stackenterprise.co/questions/ask?tags=<add tag here> ). Related topics section The related topics section comprises simple bullet list of links to other resources that are similar to the topics covered by the page you're on. Including a related topics section is a great way to connect readers with other parts of your documentation or external documentation. It optional. Style elements include: Using an H2 ## sentence case title for the section header (e.g., ## Related topics , Reference , or Further reading ). A simple bullet list of linked references. Don't use a bullet list if there's only 1 item. Just add that item under the title.

If you\u2019re stuck and aren\u2019t sure what to do, perhaps this information can get you started with a basic homepage. After reading this, we hope you learn: What type of content to include on your homepage. How to organize your homepage. How to format your homepage.

Theory and purpose It might help you to think of the homepage for your docs as a space similar to the waiting area in an airport or train station.

Bullet lists Use a bullet list when the item order or sequence is not important or required to complete a process. You can also arrange bullet list items in: Alphabetical order if there's no specific importance or relationship among the listed items. A specific order if you want to imply relative importance or a relationship among the listed items. Ascending order by word count. This imparts a visually pleasing shape to a list block that makes it look clean and neat. Numbered lists Use a numbered list when the item order or sequence is important or required to complete a process. Tip When using a numbered list to describe steps, you don't need to indicate sequence in your text. For example, avoid writing lists like this: First, complete process A. Next, activate process B. Third, click button C. Text that tells readers a step is \"first,\" \"second,\" \"third,\" or \"last,\" is unnecessary in an ordered list. Eliminate a word and let the numbers do that work for you. Formatting list text When you want to use a list: Place a colon at the end of the text or sentence fragment that introduces a list. Here's an example: The following reports are available: Report 1 Report 2 Report 3 Start each list item with a capital letter. Use a lower case letter if that's the formal name of an item (e.g., iPad, eMail) or as required to maintain accuracy. Avoid creating a list that includes sentence fragments and complete sentences. It is OK to do this if there's no other way. Sometimes you just have to, but try not to. Do not create a list that has one bullet or numbered item only. If you're doing this to highlight something important, consider putting that text in a note, tip, or warning call-out or an expand/collapse block . In technical writing, there's no such thing as a list with one bullet or numbered item. Lists must include 2, or more, items. Simple or single-item lists If your list is a simple enumeration of items that would normally create a single sentence, capitalize each list item and omit the punctuation. Here's an example: The pop-up window contains 3 buttons: Save Save all Cancel Do not punctuate enumerated list items as if they're part of a sentence. Here's an example: The pop-up window contains 3 buttons: Save, Save all, and Cancel. Lists with complete sentences If your list items are complete sentences, follow the rules of capitalization, punctuation, and grammar. Here's an example: Before you activate a campaign: Make sure that the creatives, line items, and insertion order are all active. Verify that pixels are active and associated with the correct line items. Add start and end dates to the line item. Nested lists Nested lists are lists that contain bulleted or numbered sub-lists. In technical writing, nested lists are acceptable and often necessary. For example, as shown in Task Documentation for Simple Procedures , sometimes you need a nested list to describe the options in a set of instructions like this: Click New Widget . This opens the New Widget Window. In the New Widget window: Name your widget. Identify the widget owner. Choose an application type. Write a brief description. Click Save . The bulleted items in step 2 are in an unordered, nested list. They're essential and helpful in this case. Formatting nested lists TechDocs is built on pymarkdown , which closely follows the Markdown syntax for lists . To create a nested ordered or unordered list, just indent 4-spaces under a list item as shown in the following examples. <!--- Ordered list with unordered, nested bullets ---> 1. Numbered item 1. Numbered item - Bulleted item - Bulleted item 1. Numbered item <!--- Unordered list with ordered, nested numbers ---> - Bulleted item - Bulleted item 1. Numbered item 1. Numbered item - Bulleted item Tip Indent paragraphs, images, and call-out boxes when you need to keep these objects aligned with your list items and text. Keep lists simple Nested lists become awkward and difficult to read when they go beyond 2 or 3 levels deep. For example, this list is a clumsy way to convey information: Do this. Do that with some options: Option 1 Option 2 Something else here. And one more thing. Don't forget this either. Hey, we're here too. Going even deeper. This is getting awkward. Option 3 Final item. Alternatives to nested lists When you start to create deeply nested lists, stop for a moment and think about how you're trying to convey information. Lists with 3 rd , 4 th , or N th level nesting might not be an effective way to explain something or describe a procedure. Instead of a sub-list, try putting that information: In another H2 or H3 titled section on the the same page. You might even want to add an anchor link to connect the list item to the new section. On a new, separate page that you link to from the main list. In a call-out box or expand/collapse block under a list item. These options give you room to write and eliminate the need to stuff text into an awkward set of nested lists.","title":"Lists"},{"location":"guide/style/style_lists/#lists","text":"Recommendations on formatting and using lists in your documentation.","title":"Lists"},{"location":"guide/style/style_lists/#bullet-lists","text":"Use a bullet list when the item order or sequence is not important or required to complete a process.

Bridging lets our systems identify and make connections between devices on the same network. The result is a map of all the devices on a particular network.

High scores suggest a closer connection between devices in a household than lower scores. High scores improve accuracy, but reduce reach. Low scores suggest a looser connection between devices in a household than higher scores. Low scores reduce accuracy, but increase reach. Keep in mind, however, that these scored connections are abstract representations of different data points. They are not physical links between nodes. Purpose of household scores As described in the Device Graph Overview , a device graph is a map of connected devices on a network. By itself, a device map is not very useful because the nodes and connections (edges) between them look identical. As a result, we need a way to identify and define the relationships between each device. A metric, known as a household score helps us understand the relationships between and among different devices. A household score ranges from 1 (weakest) to 10 (strongest). Devices with high scoring edges are more strongly related than devices with lower scoring edges. As an example, see the device graph below. This diagram shows devices A through E and their corresponding household scores. Within this graph: Device A shares strong connections with Devices B, C, and D. Devices B, C, D, and E share weak connections among themselves. Building household scores Our proprietary technology and algorithms help identify household devices and calculate their scores. Some key metrics that contribute to score calculations include: Frequency: Our technology increases the household score between devices that connect to the same network frequently. Recency: Our technology increases the household score between devices that connect to the same network within a set time interval. Authenticated data: Device information from sites that require authentication. These devices usually have strong household scores because the authentication process ties a device to a specific user. Important Household scores increase in value only. To avoid perpetually increasing scores, and maintain data freshness, edges can (and do) expire. The Device Graph removes expired edges and scores from household network maps. What do the scores really mean? Scores range from 1 (weakest) to 10 (strongest). Choosing one score vs another affects how many devices you can target or how many devices are available for synchronization. But, what does it mean to select a score of 3 compared to 5, or 7, or any other scores? A score of 1 represents 100% of the available edges. Each score greater than 1 reduces the available edges by 10% (e.g., score 2 reaches 90% of all edges, score 3 reaches 80%, and so on). Scores work on an equal to or greater than basis (e.g., score 7 includes all edges with the same value or higher). Score > = % of available edges 1 100% 2 90% 3 80% 4 70% 5 60% 6 50% 7 40% 8 30% 9 20% 10 10% Reach vs accuracy Reach represents how many devices are available for targeting or synchronization. Accuracy represents how precise you are at delivering relevant content to those devices. Reach and accuracy are inversely proportional. As you increase the household score: Reach decreases because score targeting includes devices that are equal to or greater than the selected score. Accuracy increases because you're more likely to reach a specific device audience. Let's use the sample device graph above to demonstrate this behavior. Say you want to synchronize Device A with all the other devices in the graph and set the household score to 7. In this case, you'll reach Devices B (score 7) and D (score 10) only because those devices share an edge with device A that is = > 7.

Pre-update budget distribution In Backoffice, a MySQL database stores budget cap information for ad serving tactics. However, the budgets aren't immediately available to the bidders. Another system, the budget allocator, needs to run first and send bidder match rate data to Watson. Match rates let Watson assign budget amounts to each bidder in proportion to the amount of bids they\u2019ve matched given the constraints set by a tactic. If the bidders don\u2019t have a budget, they\u2019ll just sent match rate data to Vertica where it\u2019s passed on to the budget allocator. In the following illustration, the green circle shows you where budget information is distributed before the budget allocator or the bidders update themselves. Post-update budget distribution Let's look at how budget data gets distributed after an update. In the following illustration, the green circle shows you where budget information is distributed after the budget allocator and bidders update themselves. The table below explains what's happening after a budget distribution cycle. System Description Budget allocator At 10-minute intervals, the budget allocator checks Vertica for bidder match rate data. It applies a factor to this data, which sets the budget for each bidder, based on their performance. The budget allocator sends this information to MySQL, which passes it on to Watson. Watson Watson is the authoritative source of budget information for the bidders. In this system, Watson: Allocates budgets to the bidders. Tracks bidder spending. Stops the bidders when they run out of budget. Bidders At 1-hour intervals, the bidders load/reload all the available campaign data from Watson. This ensures the bidders have the latest budget and campaign data. Also, this update takes bidder performance into account. As a result, the bidders receive budget amounts in proportion to their match rates, i.e., bidders that match a lot of requests receive more budget than those with fewer bid requests. Finally, the bidders continue to send match rate data to Vertica, which passes that information to the budget allocator.","title":"Understanding Budget Distribution and Update Cycles"},{"location":"samples/update-cycle/#understanding-budget-distribution-and-update-cycles","text":"The budget allocator, MySQL, Watson, Vertica and the bidders are important components that manage and distribute budgets.

For example, annotations help: Identify datasets that contain personally identifiable information (PII). Data governance teams and systems apply the appropriate level of protection to datasets that contain PII. See the Data Access and Onboarding Introduction for the most current information and an in-depth guide to this topic. Note This section requires no action . We have already annotated the data for you, but please make sure to review this information. It provides background context about data annotations. You must annotate your data when sharing it outside of your team. How to annotate To annotate data, first determine if it contains PII or not (see What is Personal Data for guidance). If your data: Does not contain PII, annotate it with { policy: { noPersonalData: true }} Contains PII, annotate the field containing personal data with the correct semantic type. If your data contains NARROW or STRICT fields, you must encrypt it. See the Padlock Documentation on encryption. Viewing annotated data Search for UserTrackCounts in the README.md of your repository. Follow the link that takes you to the UserTrackCounts Avro schema file, which should be already annotated. Your dataset includes a userId field. The userId field is based on the user_id stored in the upstream dataset, di.golden.path.Stream.days.v1.parquet . In turn, the user_id is derived from an anonymized Spotify user ID. As previous information suggests, these user ID fields contain sensitive PII that require annotations. See also, the Personal Data Semantic Type Policy spreadsheet.

Welcome to an early version of the revised Data Engineering Golden Path. The concepts, examples, and lessons in this tutorial will teach you how to publish a production-grade data endpoint via a batch data workflow (pipeline). Alpha release This tutorial is in alpha and subject to change after user testing. It is designed as an eventual replacement for the batch workflow content in the Data Engineering Golden Path. Currently, this release excludes some topics that would bring it to parity with that golden path. These include: Counters Reading from and writing to BigQuery ITGC What is a golden path? A golden path tutorial introduces you to a topic and our company-specific ways to do something. It is not the full documentation for a particular subject. Instead, a golden path touches briefly on each tool and task, and does just enough to establish the basic, opinionated, and optimal way of working. Who should use this tutorial This tutorial is designed for: New engineers who need to get up to speed with concepts and ways of working with batch data workflows. Employees changing roles within the company and who need to create and manage batch data workflows. Anyone looking for information on how to create and manage batch data workflows or who are curious about how it all works. How to use this tutorial New engineers should start at the beginning and work sequentially through each part and lesson to the end. Engineers with experience building workflows are also encouraged to follow the same beginning-to-end sequence as new engineers. If you have previous knowledge, then a more targeted approach might suit your learning style and experience, but we encourage you to work through this tutorial systematically. As you work through the Data Engineering Shiny Path, keep in mind that it introduces you to our data tooling. Again, this isn't the full documentation for those tools. This is just enough to get you started. Note Each section in this shiny path builds upon the concepts and lessons learned in the previous sections.
