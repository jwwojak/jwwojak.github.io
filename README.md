## About

Hi. My name is Joe. I'm a technical writer based in NYC. 

## Purpose
This is a test space. I'm using it to:

- Post [my resume and work experience](https://jwwojak.github.io/site/resume/resume/) for job search purposes.
- Host my [technical writing and style guide](https://jwwojak.github.io/site/). This guide started as a simple doc and has grown over the years. It contains mostly DITA-based, and common sense, tech writing rules and advice.
- Test and learn more about [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a static site generation tool.
