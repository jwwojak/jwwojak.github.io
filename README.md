## About

Hi. My name is Joe. I'm a technical writer based in NYC. 

## Purpose
This is a test space. I'm using it to:

- Host and post resume information for job search purposes.
- Learn how to use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for static site generation with GitHub.
- Post technical writing style guides and tutorials. This is information I've created over the years and brought with me to the companies I've worked at during my writing career. Link TBD.
